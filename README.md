# Smart Lock for Parking Violation ðŸš—ðŸ”’

Efficient IoT solution for managing parking violations in busy urban areas.

## Overview

Parking violations cause congestion, block emergency routes, and lead to frequent vehicle seizures, especially in densely populated countries like India. Traditional towing is slow and risky. This project introduces an IoT-based smart lock that automatically immobilizes vehicles parked illegally, notifies owners in real-time via a mobile app, and helps authorities manage incidents quickly and safely.

## Features

- **Automatic smart lock activation in restricted zones**
- **Instant owner notifications via mobile app**
- **GPS-based vehicle tracking**
- **Dashboard for authorities to manage and resolve cases**
- **No towing requiredâ€”reduces risk of vehicle damage**

## How It Works

1. Vehicle parks in a restricted area
2. Smart lock activates and immobilizes the vehicle
3. Owner receives app notification with resolution steps
4. Authority dashboard logs and manages the violation

## Tech Stack

- **Hardware:** Arduino/Raspberry Pi, GSM/GPS
- **Mobile App:** Flutter
- **Backend:** Node.js/Python, MongoDB/Firebase
- **Dashboard:** React.js

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repo:
